From the above graph we can see that total cases in India have crossed the 30 Million mark.
In the graph we can see start of exponential growth in cases at two different times signifying start of 1st and 2nd waves.

The first wave can be seen hitting near July 2020 with the growth stagnating around Jan 2020.

The Second wave was caused by spread of Delta-Variant which started spreading around March 2021 to early April 2021.
It far exceeded the severity of Wave 1, causing a shortages of Beds/Oxygen in Hospitals as they were ill equiped for this incident.
This is due to the oversight of government, and the increasing negligence of people.

This graph follows the same suit as the previous one,
the curve on this graph is identical to the last.

There have been over 29.8 Million recoveries till now.

Over 4,00,0000 people have lost their lives due to effect of Corona till now.

We can see the daily cases peak at around 1 lakh mark in Wave 1 around August/September 2020.

This graph shows us how severe the second wave was when compared to first wave.
The second wave peaked at 4 lakh mark in April 2020.


The line in the green is the daily recoveries per day.

 One can make assumption that when the  recoveries per day  > cases per day we see a decline/end of the wave.

But this reasoning is not entirely true.
We can see recovery line matching the cases line's shape.
But it is offset by 14-15 days.

It can be attributed to the fact that the person who got tested positive on that day recovered after 14 days.

For simplicity we can say - 
    If 1 lakh people tested positive on 1 June 2021
    Then most of those tested negative on 15 june 2021

We can see from the pie chart that out of all cases around 98.54% of people recovered and 1.46% of people suffered from complications.

For every 1000 people that got infected, 14-15 died due to complications.

Above graph shows us the extent of Covid-19 in Maharashtra. Leading the chart with over 6 Million cases,
it has more than double cases of Kerela which is just behind with 3 Million cases.

The reason for Maharashtra's high number of cases can be attributed to high population density in that region,
which decreases effectiveness of social distancing.

On the bottom of the graph are the States with low population densities,
islands with low human contact and states with extreme climates.

Above graph shows us the deaths per State.
Maharashtra has over 1.2 Lakh casualities with over 3 times more than Karnataka which has around 35k deaths.

Punjab is the state with lowest recovery percentage which can be due to inadequate management of Punjab Government.

Uttar-Pradesh leads the graph with total test accumulating to just under 60 Million.
But it only has 1.71 Million total positive cases,

This shows us the great management shown by UP Government to minimise the effect of Corona by performing vast amount of tests and
taking cautious approach with lockdown and curfews and dividing State into different zones to implement different restrictions
based on severity of corona in each zone.

The above graph show than more than 350 Million (35 Crore) doses have been administered in India.

Covi-Shield vaccine has a market share of 89% (rounded)
This means that 9 out 10 people have taken Covi-Shield vaccine.

Covaxin has market share of 11% (rounded)
This means 1 out of 10 people have been dosed with Covaxin.

Sputnik-V has market share of measly 0.0088 %
this is due to its late introduction in market,
and its Russian origin which affects its trust factor.

We see that 45-60 year (Cyan Line) vaccine numbers saw an exponential increase between March and April 2021.
This was due to spread of wave-2, people rushed for a vaccine when they heard how dangerous the Delta variant is.

In April 2021 we see a decrease in slope on 45+ vaccine takers which indicates that majority of those people
have already gotten atleast one dose and the shortage of vaccine could also be a contributing factor.

The purple line indicating 18-45 group has surpassed the 45+ age group and has seen immense growth over time,
Delta Variant targeted 18-45 age group more which caused a panic and a increase in vaccine deman causing shortages.

18-45 are also more aware of vaccine benefits and have more trust in Science.

Maharashtra leads the vaccination efforts to counter vast number of cases in the state.
Uttar-Pradesh is second with nearly equal doses administered as Maharashtra showing an effective handling of pandemic, 
it is followed by Gujrat which is significantly behind UP.
